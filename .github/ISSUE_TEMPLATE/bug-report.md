<!--
Please fill in as many details as you can. Just saying "it doesn't work"
will not get the problem fixed. I don't release workflows I know are
broken, so it works for me...

Please also don't waste time adding screenshots of Alfred showing an
error message. There's not enough information there to do anything with.

The *debugger* output is what matters.
-->

<!--
The versions of stuff you're running.

If you're not running the latest version of the workflow, please
update first and come back here if the problem still exists. If you're
running a version of Alfred that isn't supported, I most likely won't
fix the bug.
